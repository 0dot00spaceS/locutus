Thank you so much for becoming a Locutus contributor!

Here are a few pointers that could save us from disappointment, we'll keep it brief:

1. By submitting a Pull Request you are giving Locutus permission to distribute your code under the MIT License.
1. Please adhere to our [coding standards](/blog/2016/04/01/standard-coding-style/). Run `npm run lint`
1. Please credit yourself in the function's header-comment: `(original by|improved by|parts by|bugfixed by|revised by|input by): Your Name (http://your.url)`
1. If you're fixing bad behavior, please add an `example` that would fail before your patch, and a `result` that passes after your patch, to the function's header-comment
1. Sometimes we place `for` inside `if` for performance reasons, even if the code could be twice as small if we did this the other way around.
