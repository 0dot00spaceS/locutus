Hi all,

Already spoiled a little in [Breaking Backwards Compatibility](/blog/2016/04/20/breaking-bc/), today 
I'm launching a big iteration of this project under a new name: Locutus.

Locutus will have the same main goal as php.js did: 

> Offer the community a platform to collaborate on JavaScript counterparts 
to functions from other languages. For fun, and educational purposes.

Locutus will however have different areas of focus than before, it will focus on:

- The intellectual challenge of porting standard libraries (vs: language constructs, environment, data-types, configuration)
- Expanding to other languages, such as C, Go, Python, Ruby (vs: just PHP)
- The educational aspect and the intellectual challenge (vs: production bundles)
- Individual functions (vs: trying to provide an exhaustive ecosystem that could be used to run entire programs written in other languages, in JavaScript)
- Using npm as the main distribution platform, so you can `var strings = require('golang/strings')` (vs: Git, copy-paste, browser). If the browser is your target platform, you could use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/), or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
- Targeting Node.js as the main platform when it comes to I/O. Again, if the browser is your target, in many cases I/O does not make sense, and where it does, there's https://github.com/substack/brfs. Where possible, we'll use solutions that are portable such as `fetch` that has isomorphic implementations.

Locutus will either change or deprecate functions that don't adhere to this new vision. That's a huge job however, and in progress.

I feel these are the changes needed have a rebirth of my motivation for leading this project. For a long time I've struggled the project in its old form, and the (all too) little motivation I did have for maintenance, was driven by guilt, instead of curiosity and excitement.

I have tried to find new leadership, but there were no candidates. I considered shutting the project down, but there were too many people still enjoying it, and I feel a great deal of duty and responsibility towards past contributors. Time went on, the project and me in a deadlock, only to shortly to be relieved when my guilt had reached critical point tipping me over to sacrificing nights and weekends to the maintenance gods again.

There are several reasons why I believe my intrinsic motivation has perished:

- I hadn't been using PHP for a long time (you'll find no bitterness here, it's just how things went)
- The things that were fun to port, had been ported
- [Misuse](https://github.com/kvz/locutus/issues/75) of the project
- The world had delivered on new tech, making 9 year old code look silly (npm, Browserify, browsers supporting base64 encoding natively, etc)
- Being a visible project in the broader development community with people coming from many different programming languages, I found myself at the focal point of PHP hate which was a popular and common past time from around 2010 - 2014. Without over-analyzing it, this article about [contempt culture](http://blog.aurynn.com/86/contempt-culture) resonated with me.
- I've changed my stance on many things going from age 23 to 32. Most importantly for the project: it should not be used as a VM, a goal I had for some time, and that drove me to me write hacks that likely secured me a special place in hell.

I understand this can feel like a very radical shift, especially when there's mention of deprecating functions. Perhaps functions that you wrote with blood sweat and tears. 

Hence I want to voice a word of appreciation to all contributes, for the hard labour that went into shaping php.js. Rewriting a language in another language is no small task. People tend to forget that in order to create php.js, we had to write quite a lot of JavaScript. In trying to port the entire language instead of limiting ourselves to more sensible bits, we may have ventured into some darker areas of engineering. But I for one am very proud that we have built a welcoming friendly community where over the coarse of 9(!) years, over 600 developers have come together to learn JavaScript and help others learn it. I will accept both defeat and victory.

As a contributor of php.js, I hope you'll come with me on this new adventure, where standard libraries full of functions are just [screaming to be ported](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/). This time we'll be a little bit older. A little bit wiser, mindful of the darker areas, a bit more prudent. But we'll have just as much fun, I promise : )

For all that can forgive me if an old function of yours is hurt in the process of aligning with the project's new direction and are on board, Locutus is tagged as `v2.0.0` and available on npm as `locutus`.

You can try it right now if you want:

```bash
$ npm install --save locutus
$ vim index.js
```

```javascript
var php = require('locutus/php/strings/sprintf')
var effectiveness = 'futile'
php.echo(php.sprintf('Resistance is %s', effectiveness))
```

```javascript
var strings = require('locutus/golang/strings')
console.log(strings.Contains('Locutus', 'cut'))
```

```bash
$ node index.js
Resistance is futile
true
```

The `src/php` directory still contains a lot of functions that don't adhere jet to the project's new direction. Besides help with porting more languages, I'd love help with updating them to make them pass the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com) via [eslint](http://eslint.org/), as well as changing/deprecating the ones that involve a lot of dependencies, global scope, configuration, mimicked datatypes, or browser tie-in.

I haven't been this excited about the project in a long time, and I hope you will be too!
