Hi all,

As announced in [Breaking Backwards Compatibility](/blog/2016/04/20/breaking-bc/), today 
I'm launching an iteration of this project under a new name: Locutus.

Locutus will have the same main goal as php.js did: 

> Offer the community a platform to collaborate on JavaScript counterparts 
to functions from other languages, for fun, and educational purposes.

Locutus will however have different areas of focus than php.js had. Locutus will focus on:

- More languages, such as C, Go, Python, Ruby (not just PHP)
- npm as the main distribution platform, so you can `var strings = require('golang/strings')` (and use Browserify, Rollup, or Webpack on that if the browser is your target)
- The intellectual challenge of porting standard libraries (not language constructs, environment, data-types, configuration)
- Educational aspect and the intellectual challenge (not production)
- Providing individual functions (not try to provide a huge standard library that could be used to run entire programs written in other languages, on V8)

Locutus will either change or deprecate functions that don't adhere to this new vision (a work in progress).

I feel these are the changes I need to make in order to have a rebirth of my motivation in leading this project. For a long time I've struggled the project in its old form.

I have tried to find new leadership, but there were no real candidates. The work I have done over the past years was guilt driven.

There are several reasons why I think my intrinsic motivation has fled:

- [Misuse](https://github.com/kvz/locutus/issues/75) of the project
- I haven't used PHP myself in years (no bitterness here, that's just what happened)
- The things that were fun to port, have been ported
- I've changed my stance on a number of things (most importantly: the project should not be used as a VM, a goal that made me accept and add functions that I'm not proud of)

I'm hopeful that this new course can re-spark a flame that once was, and make me fit for leadership again. If that turns out to not be the case, we'll have to draw other conclusions.

I understand this can feel like a radical shift from the original project, especially when there's mention of deprecation. 

That is exactly what I feel was needed.

I want voice a word of appreciation for all the hard work that went into php.js by its contributors. I feel a great deal of duty and responsibility towards you. People tend to forget that in order to create php.js, we had to write quite a lot of JavaScript. Trying to port the entire language, we may have ventured into more darker areas of engineering. But I for one am very proud that we have built a welcoming friendly community where over the coarse of 9(!) years, over 600 developers have come together to learn JavaScript and help others learn it.

As a contributor of php.js, I hope you'll come with me on this new adventure, where entire standard libraries are just [screaming to be ported](https://golang.org/pkg/strings/).

This time we'll be a little bit wiser, mindful of the darker areas, a bit more prudent. But we'll have just as much fun : )

I also hope this new boost to the project, will help a little to forgive me if a legacy functions of yours get deprecated or otherwise hurt in the process of aligning the project with this new direction.

You are of course very welcome to fork php.js at the `v1.3.2` tag and continue on that road.

For all on board with Locutus, that is tagged as `v2.0.0` and available on npm as `locutus`.

You can try it right now if you want:

```bash
$ npm install --save locutus
$ vim index.js
```

```javascript
var php = require('locutus/php/strings/sprintf')
var effectiveness = 'futile'
php.echo(php.sprintf('Resistance is %s', effectiveness))
```

```javascript
var strings = require('locutus/golang/strings')
console.log(strings.Contains('Locutus', 'cut'))
```

```bash
$ node index.js
Resistance is futile
true
```

As mentioned, the `src/php` directory still contains a lot of functions that don't adhere to the project's new direction. Besides help with porting more languages, I'd love help with updating them to make them pass the [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com) via [eslint](http://eslint.org/), as well as deprecating the ones that involve a lot of dependencies, global scope, mimicked datatypes, or browser tie-in.

I haven't been this excited about the project in a long time, and I hope you will be too!
