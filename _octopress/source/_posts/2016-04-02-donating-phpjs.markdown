As the developer who created php.js 9 years as a learning experience, I'm amazed at the traction this project received, and I enjoy knowing that people coming from PHP can learn JavaScript through looking at our examples.

I've also felt really bad that people have (ab)used php.js to not have to learn JavaScript, and continue PHP-ing in the browser.

This, combined with the fact that I'm not using php.js myself for anything, makes me feel it's time to complete donating php.js to the community.

It is my believe that this transition will benefit php.js enthusiast, since the lack of my active involvement as the main project owner is currently hurting it, and has been for some time.

My proposal is to get php.js in a slightly better state, the move to standard is part of that, and I have a few other ideas for improvement on my list. After that, I'll move php.js to it's own organization on GitHub, making a few of the greatest contributors admin there.


Thanks everyone for your continued support. 

Best wishes,
