Hi everybody,

Welcome to our new site.
The old one had a lot of cruft that nobody used and was basically unmaintained.

This one is generated by Octopress as plain html, and then stored on Github pages.

The source to do that is inside the php.js directory in the `_octopress` dir, 
and freely available.

For instance, you can now very easily:

 - [edit the about page](https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/edit/master/_octopress/source/about/index.markdown)
 - [checkout the navigation](https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/blob/master/_octopress/source/_includes/custom/navigation.html)
 - [change the way function pages are built](https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/blob/master/_octopress/Rakefile#L30)

You'll need:

 - A specific ruby version, I documented it [here](http://kvz.io/blog/2012/09/25/blog-with-octopress/)
 - to hack on your files
 - to run `make site`

This should make it easy for any php.js contributor (or anybody really, using pull requests)
to update the site, making the site less dependent on few core members, and more a
community efffort.

This is also the way I want to do regular php.js development. Less via time
consuming comments, more via the power of Github.

This site should focus on being a simple resource and discussion platform, and much else.

While I'm not actively involved with php.js anymore, I hope this final investment will
make the project ready for the future.


Best wishes,
