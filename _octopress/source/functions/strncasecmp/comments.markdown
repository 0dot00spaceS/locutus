Slight grammar error:
        // avoids trying to get a char that does not exists
should be
        // avoids trying to get a char that does not exist

Also for comment:
            // str1 is lengthier than str2
&quot;longer&quot; might be better than &quot;lengthier&quot;; however, that is more of an opinion.
